	<section class="Spacing-considerations">
		<h2>Spacing considerations</h2>
		<p>Keep at least a Dropbox worth of space between the Logotype and other elements.<br>When using Glyph, it's best to leave about 30% whitespace between it and and adjacent elements.</p>
		<p>These diagrams are precise but we think your best approximation is just fine.</p>
		<p>Leave about 30% whitespace between the Dropbox Glyph, or Dropbox app icons and other elements.</p>
		<p>Reduce the Glyph by 10% when putting it inside of a circle.<br><br>Circles are nice.</p>
		<p>Thanks for not adding a tagline or motto to our logo. :)</p>

		<h2>Use of our brand materials</h2>
		<h3>In general</h3>
		<p>Please don't use our name, logos, or screenshots ("brand materials") in ways that may be confusing, misleading, or suggest our sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation. For example, your name and logo should be more prominent than the Dropbox name or logo. And please don't edit or change the Dropbox logo - we like it how it is!</p>
		<h3>Advertising, promotional, and sales materials</h3>
		<p>Please check in with us before using our logo on websites, products, packaging, manuals, or for other commercial or product use. It's ok to say in text "works with Dropbox" or "compatible with Dropbox" (as long as it's true!).</p>
		<h3>Education and instruction (books, guides, publications, and conferences)</h3>
		<p>You can use our brand materials for educational and instructional purposes, but please remember that it shouldn't be confusing or misleading, or suggest our sponsorship. We generally don't allow use of our logos or screenshots on book covers, for example.<br><br>Also remember to include this statement (or something like it) in your printed materials: "(Title) is not affiliated with or otherwise sponsored by Dropbox, Inc."</p>
		<h3>Products, websites, names and logos</h3>
		<p>Please don't use our name as a part of your company or service name, website name, trade name, or product name. Don't use our logo or incorporate our logo into yours. Don't use a domain name containing "dropbox" or any confusingly similar words.</p>
		<h3>Functional Uses (UIs / buttons)</h3>
		<p>Developers of our API can use brand materials in accordance with our Developer Branding Guidelines.</p>
		<h3>Linking to Dropbox</h3>
		<p>If you use Dropbox and want to use our logo to link to our site, you can use our logo if it meets the rest of these guidelines. For example, "we use Dropbox! [linked logo or link near logo]" or "here's a photo set (hosted on Dropbox!)."</p>
		<h3>Merchandise</h3>
		<p>While we make lots of t-shirts with our logo on them, we don't generally allow third parties to make, sell, or give away anything with our name or logo on it.</p>
		<h3>More questions?</h3>
		<p>Feel free to email brand@dropbox.com. It helps if you send a mockup of your intended use so we can be specific in our response. We'll do our best to get back to you ASAP but please give us two weeks to get back to you. (Please note that no response doesn't mean approval and that we're currently only able to respond to inquiries made in English).</p>
